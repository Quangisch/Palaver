        "Material is the metaphor.\n"

            "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion.\n"
            "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
            "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
            "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
            "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
            "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
            "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
            "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
            "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
            "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n"

            "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n"

            "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
            "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
            "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
            "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
            "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
            "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
            "waypoints for the user.\n"

            "Motion provides meaning.\n"

            "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
            "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
            "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
            "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
            "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
            "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n"

            "3D world.\n"

            "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
            "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
            "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
            "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
            "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
            "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n"

            "Light and shadow.\n"

            "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
            "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
            "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
            "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
            "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
            "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n"

            "Resting elevation.\n"

            "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
            "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
            "elevation as soon as possible.\n"

            "Component elevations.\n"

            "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
            "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
            "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
            "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n"

            "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n"

            "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
            "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
            "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
            "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
            "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
            "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
            "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
            "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
            "elevation.\n"

            "Avoiding elevation interference.\n"

            "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
            "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
            "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
            "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
            "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
            "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
            "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
            "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
            "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
            "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.";
